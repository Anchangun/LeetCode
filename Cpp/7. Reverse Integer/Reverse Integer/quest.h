 Title : 7. Reverse Integer
 Quest :
 Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.
 * Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

Example 1:
Input: x = 123
Output: 321
Example 2:

Input: x = -123
Output: -321
Example 3:

Input: x = 120
Output: 21
Example 4:

Input: x = 0
Output: 0

Constraints:

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1

Start Class : 
class cl_solution{
public :
    int reverse(int x) {

    }
};
